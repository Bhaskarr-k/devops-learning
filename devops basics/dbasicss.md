# what is devops
 - DevOps is a combination of software development and operations.
 - DevOps is not a tool it is culture (or) process
- it is a process of continuous development, continuous build,, continuous test, continuous release the software faster & reliability with automation tools.
- it is increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.
- every software company to develop an application. it has two teams

or 

- Devops is a software development methodology to deploy an application by making use of CICD, Automation and monitoring concepts.


#### development
#### operations(testing, monitoring, infrastructure)

## development
development team develop the application with some tools
- in this process include three steps that are
    #### frontend
    #### backend
    #### database
## operations
opeartions work based on testing, monitoring, infrastructure.
# why devops is importent?
- shorter development cycles that encourage innvovaion
- more collabration better communication
- reduced deployment failures and faster time to recover
- efficiency
- improved resource managment


# what are the devops roles and responsibilities?
- Devops roles and responsibilities includes deploy and built and release an application into multiple environments through automation processor using tools.
# why devops?
- GAP
- deploy faster
- ovecomes traditional
# what are the phases involved in devops and what are the tools used?
#### version control system: git
#### Build and automation tools: Maven
#### continuous integration: Jenkins
#### containerisation tools: Docker
#### Infrastructire as code: Terraform
### configuration management : Ansible
#### Container Orchestrator: kubernetes/Dcoker swarm
#### Continuous monitoring: prometheus/grafana
#### cloud computing: AWS Services for DevOps.
# what are the benfits of DevOps?
- speed
- improved collabration
- rapid development
- quality
- reliability
- security
# why do we need devops?
### better collaburation
operations teams and developers who implement develops culture remove the barriers between the departments
### maximized automation
maximized automation removes most human errors doesn't suffer continuously integrated bills are cure for a deployment and there is no way they could be tested manually 
### micro service architecture
it divides applications into loosely coupled parts and make it easier to
maintain test and reuse them 
### security improvements
because of the immediate detection of issues enabled through a direct 
environment they could be solved as quickly as  the horizon
### enhancing the communist
devops enables organizations to become the market leader as they can respond the market leader as they can respond quicker release faster and work better
